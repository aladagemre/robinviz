What to do here?

* Run termdbparser.py, it will generate goinfo.sqlite3.
* Run gotree.py, select GO terms and press the button. It will generate selected_terms.txt and sub_go_mapping.txt for selected GO terms.

===============

termdbparser.py: parses the go_daily-termdb file and generates a goinfo.sqlite3 file. This file contains a table with GOAccession, name and children fields. 

===============

gotree.py: allows you to select gene ontologies, report the selected ones and provide term-gene mapping for them.

===============

gene2goparser.py: allows you to parse gene2go file for given GO terms to produce a term-gene mapping. Produces complete go_mapping.txt (Called by gotree.py)
